### About in-class Quizzess (20%)
+ Quizz dates will show on the schedule page
+ Mostly quizzes will be on Mondays
+ Each quizz includes contents we cover in the previous week
+ We will use your top-10 quizzes to calculate the 20%.

### About Final Project (30%)
+ Each team includes up to four students 

+ By Week3, we will use a google spreadsheet to coordinating team forming and paper bidding. 
+ Please discuss with your fellow classmates, forming potential teams ASAP. 
+ We allow self-selected papers. 
+ Please share questions and concerns to  to <br>
[instructors20fall-machinelearningdeep@collab.its.virginia.edu](mailto:instructors20fall-machinelearningdeep@collab.its.virginia.edu). 

+ You can select a project from three potential types: 
  - a. [Application-Type:] To produce one machine learning project on cutting-edge data applications with health or social impacts
  - b. [Engineering-Type:] Survey and benchmark multiple pytorch library with a shared goal
  - c. [Research-Type:] To Reproduce a cutting-edge machine learning paper, for instance from Top Venues' most cited 2019 papers 
    + Here are the project presentations from 2019-Fall master-level machine learning that I offered. 
    + All were of "research-type": [https://github.com/qiyanjun/deep2reproduce](https://github.com/qiyanjun/deep2reproduce)


+ Each team is required to submit multiple documents for their project
  - 5 Points (Due in Collab at W4): A powerpoint file  summarizing the proposed benchmarking idea / or the proposed application / or the to-reproduced-paper via a template
  - 5 Points (Due in Collab at W6 ): A project proposal  summarizing the concrete project plan 
  - 5 Points (Due in Collab at W12): A iPython Jupyter notebook / or A python code repo to present your team's code, data visualization, and to obtain the results and analysis through step by step code/ cell run. Your team will go through and show the code-run at the final project presentation meeting to the instructors. 
  - 5 Points (in the last week of the semester): A formal presentation to the instructors  
  - 10 Points (in the last week of the semester): A formal report to the instructors , describing your projects: motivation, method, results and insights. 

+ For the iPython Jupyter notebook your team needs to make: 
  - A Jupyter iPython template is shared to help you structure the project code. 
  - Please read the following papers and then make your IPython Jupiter notebook: [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055)
   

+ Here is the potential paper / data / library list (TBD):
