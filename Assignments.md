### About in-class Quizzess (20%)
+ Quizz dates will show on the schedule page
+ Mostly quizzes will be on Mondays
+ Each quizz includes contents we cover in the previous week
+ We will use your top-10 quizzes to calculate the 20%. 

+ Here is the potential paper list:

### About Final Project (30%)
+ Each team includes up to four students 
+ To understand, reproduce and present one cutting-edge machine learning paper

+ Each team is required to submit three documents for their project
  - 5 Points: A powerpoint file (Due in Collab on Oct 20th) summarizing the paper via a template
  - 5 Points: The updated powerpoint file (Due in Collab on Nov 30th) summarizing the paper via a template and describing the results you reproduce
  - 5 Points: A iPython Jupyter notebook (Due in Collab on Dec 7th) to present the code, data visualization, and to obtain the results and analysis through step by step code cell run. Your team will go through and show the notebook at the final project presentation meeting to the instructors. 
  - 5 Points: A formal presentation to the instructors (in the last week of the semester), presenting your slides and your iPython notebook. 
  - 10 Points: A formal report to the instructors (in the last week of the semester), describing your projects: motivation, method, results and insights. 

+ For the iPython Jupyter notebook your team needs to make: 
  - A Jupyter iPython template is shared to help you structure the project code. 
  - Please read the following papers and then make your IPython Jupiter notebook: [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055)


+ By Week3, we will use a google spreadsheet to coordinating team forming and paper bidding. 
+ Please discuss with your fellow classmates, forming potential teams ASAP. 
+ We allow self-selected papers. 
+ Please share questions and concerns to  to <br>
[2020fall-machinelearningdeep-instructors@collab.its.virginia.edu](mailto:2020fall-machinelearningdeep-instructors@collab.its.virginia.edu). 

+ You can select a project from three potential types: 
  - a. To produce one machine learning project on cutting-edge data applications with health or social impacts
  - b. Survey and benchmark multiple pytorch library with a shared goal
  - c. To Reproduce a cutting-edge machine learning paper, for instance from Top Venues' most cited 2009 papers 
   

+ Here is the potential paper list (TBD):
