AI/ML on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting of building and setting up hardware and infrastructure from each step of the machine learning process, so you can focus on your models.

In this session, we will provide you with an overview of the AI/ML stacks on AWS, how machine learning is done on AWS using Amazon SageMaker Studio, and built-in algorithms and new features of SageMaker and SageMaker Studio.
